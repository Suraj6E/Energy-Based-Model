## ABSTRACT
Energy-based models (EBMs) are a class of machine learning models that learn to represent complex data distributions by assigning an energy score to each data point. These models are based on the principle of energy minimization, where lower energy values correspond to more plausible or likely data points. Unlike traditional probabilistic models that directly model the probability distribution of data, EBMs focus on learning the energy function that assigns low energy to observed data and higher energy to data points that are unlikely or improbable. 
## INTRODUCTION:
Energy-based models (EBMs) have emerged as powerful tools in the realm of machine learning, offering a flexible framework for capturing complex dependencies within data. With their capacity to learn from unlabeled data and generate samples, EBMs present a promising avenue for advancing various data science tasks. This thesis proposal outlines a comprehensive investigation into the utilization of EBMs to address key challenges in data science, aiming to contribute novel methodologies and insights to the field.
 
## BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION:
Data science encompasses a diverse set of disciplines, including but not limited to data analysis, pattern recognition, and predictive modeling. Traditional approaches often rely on supervised learning paradigms, which necessitate large labeled datasets and may struggle with capturing intricate data distributions. Conversely, EBMs offer a principled framework for unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, allowing for the modeling of data distributions without the need for explicit labels. The motivation behind this research lies in harnessing the potential of EBMs to enhance various data science tasks, such as anomaly detection, generative modeling, and representation learning.
